Capone is a generic service framework which can be used to
connect different resources with each other. The overarching aim
is to have all network traffic completely authenticated and
secure, such that noone is able to perform unintended actions,
except people having the right to do so.

To achieve this goal, Capone uses capabilities. A capability is
bound to a certain user and grants him the right to perform a
single, clearly defined action. After a capability has been
issued, the person for whom the capability has been created may
present it to the service to then execute the desired action.

This project provides core functionality, that is the server
which handles access control and mediates access to service
plugins, a simple service discovery daemon as well as a command
line client to access functionality.

## Services

Currently, there is a small number of core services implented
which act as a proof of concept. These services include:

- a service to pass on capabilities
- a service to request capabilities from other users
- a service to forward input devices based on Synergy
- a service to forward displays based on Xpra
- a service to execute arbitrary commands

Other services will follow.

## Building

The project is implemented in C, using CMake as its build system.
It currently builds on both Linux and macOS with GCC and Clang as
well as on Windows using MSYS. To build the core components,
following dependencies are required:

- protobuf v2.5.0 or greater
- protobuf-c v1.0.2 or greater
- libsodium v1.0.8 or greater
- cmocka (optional, for tests only)
- libx11, libxi, libxtst (optional, for a single benchmark only)

Building the project is simple, then:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/capone-project/capone-core.git
$ cd capone-core
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

This will build the capone library as well as core executables.
If the optional dependencies required for tests and benchmarks
are present, these will be built, as well.
