 *
 * @brief Module handling protocols
 *
 * This module provides functions for using the protocols.
 * There currently exist four different protocol end points
 * handled by the server:
 *  - query: Query a service. This will return info like its
 *    type, version, location and available parameters.
 *  - request: Request a new session with a set of parameters.
 *    The session can later be connected to to start it.
 *  - connect: Connect to an already established session and
 *    invoke the associated service to start using its
 *    functionality. This consumes the session.
 *  - terminate: Terminate an established session. This can only
 *    be invoked by the session issuer.
