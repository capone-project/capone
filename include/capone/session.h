 *
 * @brief Module handling session management
 *
 * Sessions are used to encapsulate parameters associated with a
 * concrete invocation of a service. Clients may request a
 * session that for a certain service that may be later invoked
 * by the client or another party to start using the service.
 *
 * When requesting a session, the client has to choose parameters
 * associated with the session, which are passed on to the
 * service as soon as the session is started.
 *
 * Furthermore, the session requester has to specify an identity
 * for the invoker. This will most often be the requester
 * himself, but may be another identity when the session should
 * be invoked by someone else.
 *
 * Sessions represent a kind of capability. That is they bundle
 * together a session identifier used to distinguish sessions
 * with an invoker. When a client wants to start a session, it is
 * checked if any capability is present with the session
 * identifier given by the client and his identity. If such a
 * session exists, then the client may invoke it, otherwise he
 * will be refused.
 *
 * Sessions may be revoked by the session issuer. When an
 * identity requests a session for another identity but later
 * decides to revoke the capability, he may do so. As such, the
 * invoker is part of the session in order to keep track of who
 * is able to revoke the session.
 *
 * The session parameters can only be chosen by the session
 * issuer. This is by design so that the invoker is not able to
 * escalate privileges specified by the session's parameters.
