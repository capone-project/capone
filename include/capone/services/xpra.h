 * @brief Service handling xpra display connections
 *
 * The Xpra service provides the ability to connect a display to
 * an xpra instance running on a client and like this forward the
 * client's windows to the service and display it.
 *
 * Xpra is a multi-platform screen and application forwarding
 * system that builds upon the X11 windowing system. Despite its
 * X11 heritage, it also provides implementations for Microsoft
 * Windows and OS X to forward their applications.
 *
 * The architecture is such that the client wishing to connect to
 * the service has to start a local Xpra server. The Xpra server
 * starts a virtual framebuffer in which the applications which
 * are to be forwarded are spawned in.
 *
 * When connecting to the service, the server will start an Xpra
 * client which will connect to the Xpra server running on the
 * client. All traffic between Xpra server and client will now be
 * tunneled through an encrypted channel.
